        <h1>myFlix: a Movie API Application</h1>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
            application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
        <h3>User Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users should be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that they can learn more about movies they’ve watched or are interested in.</li>
            <li>Users should be able to create a profile so they can save data about their favorite movies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Essential Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Return a list of ALL movies to the user</li>
            <li>Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user</li>
            <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”)</li>
            <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
            <li>Allow new users to register</li>
            <li>Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)</li>
            <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites</li>
